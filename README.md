# VoidNote

It is pretty private and simple, I came up with it during a one week dive after reading *Python Cryptography* by Anish Nath (2018)  
like a while ago, I happened to stumble upon this project today so I decided to upload it here as this account is dead.  
Made some tweaks to it since I found it but it's nowhere near something I'm proud of.


### what it is for
honestly it can be anything from passing along a password,  
to a journalist transferring fragile material.  
use it when you want a message to exist only long enough to do its job >_>


### how it works
you write → it encrypts → it gives you a link → they open it once → it burns.  
you can add a passphrase, require two keys to unlock, or just let the system handle it.


### reminder
if i were you i would not use this for illegal "activity's" not out of moral policing,  
but because I moved this from my vps to Render and tied it up with an uptime software, so if youre planning illegal activity's dont rely on this as I no longer hold control over logs.
(none of this is encouragement for bad behavior, it is just practical advice.)  
thus, use it in a safe space. 


{If you want root control of logs and network, need to self host in a specific jurisdiction, or want to audit every layer of the stack, run VoidNote on your own VPS or bare metal. same code, more control. (not a how to for breaking laws, just the system design.)}

I'll add decent mobile integration soon... hopefully .
