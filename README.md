# VoidNote

It is pretty simple, private, and came up with it during a one week dive after reading *Python Cryptography* by Anish Nath (2018) Like a while ago, I happened to stuble upon this project today so I decided to upload it here as this account is dead. Made some tweaks to it since I found it but it's nowehre near something I'm proud of.

### what it is for
honestly it can be anything from passing along a password,  
to a journalist transferring fragile material.  
use it when you want a message to exist only long enough to do its job >_>

### how it works
you write → it encrypts → it gives you a link → they open it once → it burns.  
you can add a passphrase, require two keys to unlock, or just let the system handle it.

### reminder
if i were you i would not use this for illegal stuff not out of moral policing,  
but because most browsers are packed with trackers and weak extensions that leak data anyway.  
(none of this is encouragement for bad behavior, it is just practical advice.) Thus use it in a safe space.

{If you want root control of logs and network, need to self host in a specific jurisdiction, or want to audit every layer of the stack, run VoidNote on your own VPS or bare metal. same code, more control. (not a how to for breaking laws just the system design.)}
PS: I moved this from my vps on RENDER tied to an uptime software as I couldnt be bothered to have this on my own server.
